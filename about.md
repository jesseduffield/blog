I'm Jesse Duffield, a software engineer in Melbourne, Australia. I made [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker), and I don't intend on slowing down until every developer is as lazy as me.

I also created [Horcrux](https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux), a program that encrypts your file into fragments that can then be recombined to obtain the original file, without the need for a password.

At my day job I work in React and Rails with some Go sprinkled in, but at home I spend most of my time writing Go.

I also have another blog where I think out loud about psychology and philosophy but I'm too scared to deanonymise that one yet. Let me know if you want that to change!
