I'm Jesse Duffield, a software engineer in Melbourne, Australia. My goal is to empower other developers to be lazy like me.

Some of my projects:

- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - a terminal-UI for git (Go)
- [Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) - a terminal-UI for docker (Go)
- [Lazycli](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazycli) - a simple terminal-UI builder (Rust)
- [Horcrux](https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux) - a program that encrypts your file into fragments that can then be recombined to obtain the original file, without the need for a password. (Go)
- [_OK?_](https://github.com/jesseduffield/ok) - a joke programming language (Go)

At my day job I work in React and Rails with some Go/Rust sprinkled in, but at home I spend most of my time writing Go.

I also have another blog where I think out loud about psychology and philosophy but I'm too scared to deanonymise that one yet. Let me know if you want that to change!
