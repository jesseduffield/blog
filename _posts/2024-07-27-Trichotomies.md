If you've ever taken a class in persuasive language, or if you've ever joined a debating club, or if you've ever listened to a politician's speech, you'll know that humans love their triplets:

- I came, I saw, I conquered
- Unit, God, Country
- The Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit
- Hook, Line, Sinker
- Live, Laugh, Love
- Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness

Why does the number three hold such a special place in the human heart? Here's one theory: with two points you can only form a line in one-dimension (boring and useless), but with _three_ points you get promoted into the second dimension with a triangle (exciting, and powerful). You might think that structures with four points (like squares) are the backbone of 3D environments. Nope! four points is overkill; zoom into any computer-generated 3D environment and you'll find it's all composed of little triangles.

Triangles are central to structural engineering: we use trusses (triangular structures) in our tables, bridges, and roofs to prevent them from collapsing under force. MythBusters proclaimed that triangles are [the strongest shape](https://www.mathaware.org/why-are-triangles-the-strongest-shape-unveiling-the-secrets-of-structural-stability/).

Okay, so triangles are important in our three-dimensional world. Why, then, are humans so hypnotised by triplets in spoken language?

The human psyche is heavily influenced by geometry after spending millions of years of evolution hurling spears at animals for our next meal. Even 3.7 billion years prior when we were amoeba, uselessly floating around in the ocean with impunity, we were still interacting with things in physical space. Comparatively, we've only had spoken language for about 2 million years, i.e. 0.05% of our evolutionary history. After all that time spent thinking in geometric terms, it's no wonder we try so hard nowadays to represent abstract concepts visually to help us make sense of them, hence the common phrase 'ummm... perhaps you could explain with a diagram?'.

Geometric metaphors abound in our everyday life. When the news reporter informs you that that Nvidia stock went up, the stock price didn't _actually_ go up, instead the stock price increased in value. You're probably thinking 'what's the difference?!' and that's because you've spent so long associating the word 'increase' with 'up' and 'decrease' with 'down' that you've forgotten that it's an arbitrary association which we only created in the first place to help us visualise numbers in our geometry-obsessed heads.

It should be no surprise then that although LLMs (Large Language Models, like ChatGPT) can outperform many humans on medical and legal tests, the one test where they hilariously under-perform compared to humans is the [ARC test](https://arcprize.org/) which is entirely composed of... wait for it... basic geometric puzzles:

Which brings us back to triplets. When you hear a triplet like 'Mind, Body, Spirit', it _feels_ stable and sound, because humans have a deep intuition that triangles comprised of three interconnected concepts are just as strong as the triangles that hold our bridges together in the real world.

But is this intuition right? Are our triplets actually meaningful or are they just arbitrary?

I want to focus on a specific kind of triplet: a _trichotomy_, which means a breakdown of something into three parts (compared to a dichotomy which involves only two parts)

Let's take an example: In school I was told there are three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Oh wait... except there's a fourth one called 'plasma', and if you look hard enough you'll also encounter '[Boseâ€“Einstein condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate)' and '[Fermionic condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermionic_condensate "Fermionic condensate")'. Okay, so much for that trichotomy.

Let's try another one: the three branches of government: legislative (writes laws), executive (enforces laws) and judiciary (interpret laws). There's no need to stop at three: we could include The People (votes representatives into power) and The Press (holds other branches accountable) but even if we believe the original trichotomy makes sense, notice that it's _by design_! There are many countries that make [no attempt](https://youtu.be/Ggz_gd--UO0?t=96) to separate the executive from the legislative, and there are some countries with no separation at all. Verdict: arbitrary.

To use an earlier example, what about Mind, Body, and Spirit? Well, the atheists in the room take issue with the inclusion of 'Spirit', and the sociologists are wondering why 'Community' wasn't included. Arbitrary.

Let's bring it a little closer to home. I remember at a previous company where for a time, Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) was all the rage. Atomic Design is a conceptual framework for organising system UX components into three elements: atoms, molecules and organisms. I remember disputes about whether a given component was an atom or a molecule and in the end it just didn't matter. Some things (like UX components) exist on a continuum and when you insist on a rigid taxonomy you end up just adding friction and creating arguments over nothing. The map is [not](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/) the territory! Another arbitrary trichotomy.

Are there any trichotomies that actually hold water? Yes! Some examples

- Past, present, and future
- Win, lose, draw
- The three horns of a triceratops

What do these examples have in common? They each just break down into dichotomies. With past, present, and future you've got time split into two halves (past and future) and we designate the place that they meet in the middle to be deserving of its own category (the present). With the horns of a triceratops you're asking two yes/no questions: is the horn on the brow or the nose? And if it's on the brow, is the horn on the left or the right? With win, lose, draw the two yes/no questions are 'did one of us beat the other?' and 'if so, who?'.

My ultimate contention is this: _any trichotomy which doesn't break down into one or two dichotomies is almost certainly arbitrary and some guy just coined it years ago and nobody has questioned it since._

To be clear, there's nothing wrong with an arbitrary trichotomy! Many trichotomies are useful despite being arbitrary: for example, the _Hungry, Humble, Smart_ trifecta is a great heuristic when hiring talent. But you should be _aware_ of the arbitrariness, so that you don't become dogmatic and end up wasting time arguing about how some edge case maps onto the trichotomy.

So, next time somebody invokes a trichotomy, keep in mind that it's almost certainly arbitrary. Follow this advice and you are guaranteed to be happy, healthy, and whole.

## Appendix: More examples

I've left these out of the body of the post because it was already long enough but if you're interested, here's some more examples:

### Freud's id, ego, and super-ego

Straight from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego), look at this diagram and tell me that's not two dichotomies! Although I'd slice it the other way: seems like the two questions are 'are you bottom-up or top-down?' (with ego being top-down) and then 'are you positively or negatively valenced?' (with id being positively valenced and super-ego being negatively valenced)

### Plato's tripartite soul

The man (rationality), the lion (pride, etc), and the beast (base desires). This seems just arbirary to me: you could argue it's two dichotomies ('is it emotional?', 'is it noble emotions or not?') but I think it's fuzzier than that and I'd class this as simply arbitrary: you could easily fit more elements in like 'the child', or 'the witness'.

### Hegel's Dialectic

The idea here is that there's thesis (some idea), antithesis (some conflicting idea), and synthesis (some resolution of the two ideas). This has a similar structure to past, present, future in that it's really just two things (thesis and antithesis) and a separate category for how they interact. So... I would not class this as arbitrary. There are lots of smart people who see everything through the lens of this dialectic but it's always struck me as being so general that it's not useful.

### The COM-B model of behavioural change

I happen to know that this gets used in physio-therapy research. The idea is that behaviour is influenced by three factors: capability, motivation, and opportunity. I think this is a uniquely bad trichotomy: not only do they all interact in convoluted aways, but for very simple situations it's not clear how to categorise things: if somebody is clinically depressed and can't get out of bed, is that a motivation issue or a capability issue? If somebody loses their job and can't afford a treatment, is that an opportunity issue or a capability issue?

### Quadrichotomies

I've confined this post to only talk about trichotomies but it only gets worse when you think about partitions of four or more elements. The example that inspired this post was actually a quadrichotomy on Eric Weinstein's podcast The Portal, with guest Agnes Callard. Eric suggested that to resolve a debate about truth, you could posit the following four elements: truth, meaning, fitness, and grace. Agnes [responded](https://moses.land/transcript-agnes-callard-and-eric-weinstein-on-the-portal-episode-23/):

> Okay, so So first of all, like, I think anytime you divide things and like philosophers disagree about this, like some philosophers are fine with a certain thing Iâ€™m about to describe, but like, I think you canâ€™t just divide things into four things. Youâ€™re like, here are the four things. These are the things I found. Iâ€™m like, well, whatâ€™s the principle of division? Like? Is that just something you made up? Like, what if we come up with a fifth one? So I want to understand it. I want to understand sort of how the whole is articulated into those things. Until I understand that I just donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve, Iâ€™ve understood anything.

There are plenty of quadrichotomies that just encode two dichotomies: one that comes to mind is the example from [Prometheus Rising](https://www.amazon.com.au/Prometheus-Rising-Robert-Anton-Wilson/dp/0692710604) that explains the four temperaments: The Eagle (I'm okay, you're not okay), The Lion (I'm okay, your okay), The Bull (I'm not okay, you're not okay) and The Angel (I'm not okay, you're okay).
