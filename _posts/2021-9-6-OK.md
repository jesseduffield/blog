title: A Language To Make Programming Magical Again
---

Do you remember when you first wrote your first program? I do: back in primary school my dad gave me a copy of 'The Games Factory': a GUI for building 2D games with raster graphics. I didn't write a single line of code: it was just a matter of checking a bunch of options and arranging objects on a screens. But from day one I was hooked, and now years later I've made programming my career.

I've enjoyed my time working predominantly with Ruby, React, and Go, but I would be lying if I said that I still felt the magic that I felt back when I was a kid making games.

So I decided to spend some time working on my own programming language that would reignite my passion for coding (and maybe the passions of others as well), and after much hard work I can safely say I've achieved that goal.

Introducing the [_OK?_](https://github.com/jesseduffield/ok) language. _OK?_ is a dynamically typed language with full concurrency support and a _very_ opinionated compiler.

_OK?_ has a single goal: to give you what you _need_ to create software that feels magical to use, and magical to write. I stress the word _need_ there because I've seen languages that give developers whatever they _want_ tend to devolve into inpenetrable messes of abstraction. _OK?_ has a focus on minimalism that goes beyond other languages.

To give one brief example, _OK?_ does away with if statements, instead making [extensive use](https://github.com/jesseduffield/ok#conditionals) of switch statements, so instead of...

```go
if x {
  z = z + 2;
} else {
  onFalse();
}
```

... we use a far more readable approach ...

```go
switch x {
  case true: z = z + 2;
  case false: onfalse();
}
```

Another quick example: _OK?_ only has [one comparison operator](https://github.com/jesseduffield/OK/blob/master/README.md#one-comparison-operator): the greater-than-or-equals operator (`>=`). So instead of writing `a < b` you would write `!(a >= b)`.

Do these features sound a little crazy to you? It's okay, that's a typical response to seeing _OK?_'s syntax for the first time. Have a look at our [testimonials](https://github.com/jesseduffield/OK/blob/master/README.md#testimonials) to see some people who started off just as skeptical as you but soon had that 'aha' moment where everything clicked.

If you want to learn more, you can check out the language's features in the [readme](https://github.com/jesseduffield/ok), or you can play around with the language yourself in the [playground](https://www.okquestionmark.org/).
